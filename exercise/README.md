# Lecture Exercise

For this exercise, the goal is to create a Pizza class

1. Create the pizza class and practice initializing new instances through binding.pry
2. Add an 'initialize' method that sets the attributes: name, ingredients and desc. 
3. In pry, create a new instance and try to read the attributes of that instance, starting with the name. (Write out the method, without using a macro)
4. If this didn't work, think about what method could be missing to read the objects attributes (Write out the method, without using a macro)
5. Refactor these two methods using a macro
6. Now try to reassign the name of the pizza, whats missing here?
7. Create an instance method called 'pizza_details' and print the objects attributes. Think about how 'self' can be used here.
